              * Introduction To DBMS :->

                 A database management system is a software system designed to create and manage data in an organized manner. We will discuss DBMS, why we 

            need it, applications, types, and characteristics. We will look at components, advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. 

            We will also talk about the various database languages and database design.  





           * Types of Database Management System 

           1) Relational: 

              Relational DBMS is the most popular DBMS. In big organizations, it works with large and structured data. 

              It is based on a relational model that classifies the data into tables or relations. For example - Oracle and MySQL.  



          2) Non Relational: 

              Non-relational databases offer flexibility and scalability. Non-relational DBMS uses several 

              data models to handle unstructured and real-time data scalability.   



         3) Hierarchical: 

            Hierarchical DBMS organizes data into a tree-like structure. A hierarchical DBMS is ideal for 

            organizations with finite data access requirements. For example - Integrated Data Store (IDS) and IBM's Information Management System.  





       4) Network: 

  
          Network DBMS stores data in a network model. A network DBMS is used in organizations with complex data relations.

          For example - total information management system (TIMS). 




       * Types of Database Languages

        1) Data Manipulation Language (DML):->

           (DML) in DBMS is a syntax. It is used to change, update, and retrieve the data stored in a database. It allows the users to 

           interact with the DBMS efficiently. Some standard DML statements include Select, insert, update, and delete.



       2) Data Definition Language (DDL):->

          Data Definition Language (DDL) in DBMS is a syntax. It is used to describe the structure of database objects. It is required in DBMS as it helps

          to store and efficiently manage data. Some standard DDL statements are Create Table, Alter table, Create index, and Create view.    




        3) Data Control Language (DCL):->


          Data Control Language (DCL) in DBMS is a syntax. It is used to ensure the security, accessibility, and integrity of data in a DBMS. It is a SQL
 
          component that allows the database administrator to control access to the data. It ensures the protection of data from 

          unauthorized access and modification.  



       4) Transaction Control Language (TCL):->

          Transaction control language (TCL) in DBMS is a set of commands. It is used to manage the transactions and control the changes in a 

          database. TCL aims to ensure data integrity and consistency of the database. The standard TCL commands are - Commit, Rollback, and Savepoint.
